# 🧠 GraphScript Runtimes

Prebuilt, portable Python environments for running GraphScript tools - no Python installation required.

# 📦 What is this?

This repository provides platform-specific standalone Python runtimes used by the GraphScript Engine and its tools. It ensures consistent execution across systems, even if Python is not installed on the user’s machine.

Each folder contains a fully set up venv for a specific OS + architecture.

# ⚠️ Notes
- These runtimes may be large.
- Cross-platform usage is not guaranteed.
- Avoid modifying contents of venv after upload unless doing a rebuild.
